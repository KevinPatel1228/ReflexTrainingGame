# ðŸŽ® ReflexTrainingGame

- A simple game I made for my web programming project. Made with JavaScript, the aim of this game is to click the circle as fast as you can, and try not to miss any! The game gets progressively more difficult as time goes on!! this game is aimed at honing your reflexes, reaction time and mind to muscle connection!
